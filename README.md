# HybPiper_phasing_phyloscripts_modified

Modifications of scripts from https://github.com/mossmatters/phyloscripts/tree/master/alleles_workflow and phyloscripts in general (notably `haplonerate.py`) to make them work (for me at least); plus SLURM submission scripts with various bash commands to help the process.

Various dependencies: see the readme at above link.
